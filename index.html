								<p class="content">The GS has always been an out-of-the-box motorcycle, to the point that it has built its own box. That begins just from the way it looks. By no means is it a classically beautiful motorcycle. However, instantly recognisable, immensely eye-catching and, to my eyes, very handsome. But the real like-nothing-else character comes alive with the riding experience.The more commonly known Telelever effect is that there’s very little dive under braking, something you’ll soon get accustomed to and even grow to trust and enjoy. What I’m far more impressed with, though, is just how light it makes the handlebar feel. That’s because BMW only needed to use a 37mm fork here. In heavy city traffic, or on tricky off-road surfaces, this low effort steering on an otherwise enormous 249kg beast is just wonderful. <br><p text-align="right">-Autocarindia.com</p></p>
